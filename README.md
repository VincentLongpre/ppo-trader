## Introduction

This project implements a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for training agents in different environments. The primary focus is on comparing the performance of our PPO implementation with Stable Baselines' implementation on the Pendulum and custom StockEnv environments.

## Features

- Implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
- Compares performance with Stable Baselines' implementation
- Evaluates on Pendulum and custom StockEnv environments
